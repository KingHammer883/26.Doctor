    "The program consist of a set of collaborating functon that share a common data pool.\n",

    "Two of the data sets are the hedges and the qualifiers. Because these collections do not change and their elements must be selected at random, you can use tuples to represent them. Their names, of course, are hedges and qualifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other set of data consists of mapping between first-person pronouns, and secondperson pronouns. For example, when the program sees \"I\" in patient's input, it should respond with a sentence containing \"you\". The best type of data structure to hold these correlations is a dictionary. This dictionary is named replacements.\n",

    "The main function displays a greeting, displays a prompt, and waits for user input. The following is pseudocode for the main loop:\n",

    "Out therapist might not be an expert, but there is no charge for its service. What's more, our therapist seems willing to go on forever. However, if the patient must quit to do something else, he/she can do so by typing \"quit\" to end the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reply functio expencts the patient's string as an argument and returns another string to reply. This function implements the two strategies for making replies suggested in teh analyst phase. A quarter of the time a hedge is warranted. \n",
    "Otherwise, the function constructs to reply by changing the persons in the patient's input and appending the result to a randomly selected qualifier. The reply function calls yet another function, changePerson, to perform the complex task of changing persons.\n",
